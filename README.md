**`ngx-meta`** updates the **page title** and **meta tags** every time the route changes, based on **Angular** app's route
configuration.
- When the **Angular** app uses **server-side** rendering, the meta tags and page titles generated by **`ngx-meta`** successfully
appear on HTML source, due to its platform-free workflow. This allows the SPA to be **crawled and rendered** by the search
engines, as well as **sharing** the website **link** on social networks (facebook, twitter, etc).
- It also supports resolving values [using a `callback` function](https://github.com/fulls1z3/ngx-meta/tree/master/packages/@ngx-meta/core/README.md#using-a-callback-function)
to use a custom logic on the meta tag contents (*`http-get`, [@ngx-translate/core], etc.*).  

#### NOTICE
> If you're using `@angular v4.x.x`, use the latest release of `v0.4.x` (*[master] branch*).

> If you're using `@angular v2.x.x`, use the latest release of `v0.2.x` (*[v0.2.x] branch*).
